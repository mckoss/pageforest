        <p>We add a unique code to your own page URL each time a user saves your web page.
        That way, they can send a link to your site via email, or IM, or share it on social bookmarking sites like Digg and faves.com.
        You will get additional word-of-mouth traffic to your web site each time it is shared.</p>
