<h1>We Love Programming...</h1>
<blockquote><h1>We Love JavaScript...</h1></blockquote>

Between us, Johann and I have been programming computers for over 40 years.  Starting
with the earliest days of the personal computer, I cut my teeth programming the Apple ][.
Back then (1977), a personal computer had no operating system, word processor, spreadsheet,
or first-person shooter.  Just about all a personal computer was good for was learning to
program (in Basic or 6502 assembler, in the case of the Apple ][).

With the advent of the Internet, Netscape introduced the JavaScript programming language
in their web browser.  JavaScript has since evolved from a denigrated "scripting language"
to the foundation of a new class of "Web 2.0" applications.  With the emergence of HTML 5,
the JavaScript environment is becoming a full featured application development environment.

Some of the reasons we love JavaScript programming:

  1. We can share our programs with just about anyone with an Internet connection, with no need for a separate installation step.
  1. Our programs can run across the widest variety of computers and operating systems, compared with any other programming language or environment.
  1. JavaScript is a _modern_ programming language - with advanced object oriented features, functional programming features, and rich data structures.
  1. Our programs are inherently "open source".  Which means that we can learn by reading the creation of other programmers, just as they can share our programming ideas.
  1. The JavaScript community has created a rich set of high quality libraries to help building our own programs.

For all the strengths of JavaScript, it's not generally possible to create full-featured
web applications completely in JavaScript.  With pageforest, we aim to enable JavaScript developers to build complete web applications while concerning themselves only with the
client-side JavaScript/HTML/CSS environment.

We do this by providing the following services:

  1. **User account management** - pageforest handles registering user accounts.
  1. **Storage** - pageforest supports a simple _persistence_ model, allowing applications to save their state, on behalf of their users, to the pageforest service.
  1. **Document management** - pageforest users can collect an manage all of their pageforest documents on the pageforest web site.
  1. **Applicaton directory** - we help promote applications written using our services.

In the future we hope to provide:

  1. The ability accept payment for applications.
  1. Application analytics for developers.
